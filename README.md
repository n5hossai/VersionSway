# versionControl
- [x] Built a version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- [x] The program is used to fetch previous versions of a file with linear time traversals.
- [x] Implementation is done with linked-list Node class using C++.

## How to run the file
1. Download the version control folder. It has both the source files and the executable file.
2. You can use the executable file in any shell to be run. (To run the executable file type *./main* )
3. If you want to make the files, go to the source folder from your terminal. check with *ls* to see if you have the files
   * __versionControl.cc__
   * __versionControl.h__
   * __main.cc__
   * __Makefile__
4. If you have trouble making the file, try checking if you have put the "tab" prooperly and indent them accordingly.
5. Run make from terminal in the same directory.
